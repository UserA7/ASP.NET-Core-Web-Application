Architecture
PlaylistMVC follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into four main components:
Model: Represents the application's data and business logic. It includes entities, data access code, and business rules.
View: Displays the user interface and interacts with the user. It presents the data from the model and sends user input to the controller.
Controller: Handles user requests, interacts with the model and the view, and manages the application's flow. It processes user input, updates the model, and renders the appropriate view.
Migrations: Contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.
